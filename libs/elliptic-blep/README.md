# Elliptic BLEP

This provides BLEP antialiasing, for producing a sampled signal from a continuous-time polynomial-segment signal, based on an 11th-order continuous-time 20kHz elliptic lowpass.  It uses pre-designed coefficients for simplicity.

The filter is expressed as the sum of 1-pole filters, since they're easy to deal with in continous time.  It can be redesigned using the Python/SciPy code in `design/`, which outputs coefficients as C++ code.

## How to use

This is a header-only C++ template:

```cpp
#include "elliptic-blep.h"

signalsmith::blep::EllipticBlep<float> blep;
```

### Methods

The `EllipticBlep` class has these methods:

* `.get(samplesInFuture=0.0)`: sums the 1-pole states together to get the filter output (up to 1 sample in the future).
* `.step(samples=1.0)`: moves the filter state forward in time, by some (positive) number of samples
* `.add(amount, blepOrder, samplesInPast=0.0)`: adds in some event for which the aliasing should be canceled (up to 1 sample in the past)
* `.reset()`

The `blepOrder` argument of `.add()` specifies which type of discontinuity (where `0` is an impulse, `1` is a step discontinuity, `2` an instantaneous gradient change etc.), and `amount` specifies how much the corresponding differential changed by.

Make sure that you have added all events before calling `.get()` (especially if peeking at future output using `.get(fracSamples)`).

### Default BLEP vs "direct" mode

The default mode is the classic BLEP pattern: you synthesise a waveform which will contain aliasing, and then add in an aliasing-cancellation signal.

![impulse response for default BLEP mode](doc/double-residue-impulse-top.svg)

In this mode, the sample-rate argument is optional, and is only needed if you want to have the exact same phase response (or cutoff) at different rates.

#### Direct mode

If `direct` is enabled during initialisation, you don't have to synthesise the waveform yourself - the step/ramp/etc. will be included in the filter's output:

![impulse response for direct mode](doc/double-direct-impulse-top.svg)

The sample-rate is not optional for this mode, because the output will be highpassed at 20Hz and that needs to be correctly placed.  It also only works for purely polynomial-segment signals, and you *have* to inform the class of every discontinuity (including at the start of synthesis).

#### Impulses

You can add impulses (using `blepOrder=0`).  Even in default BLEP mode, there is no "naive" signal equivalent for these, so they are always used directly (although default BLEP mode doesn't include the 20Hz highpass).

### Phase compensation

There is an `EllipticBlepAllpass` template as well, which adds phase-shifts to make the BLEP filter approximately linear-phase.

```cpp
EllipticBlep<float> blep;
EllipticBlepAllpass<float> blepAllpass;

// using the BLEP in default mode (adding BLEP residue to a naive signal)
float minPhaseY = aliasedY + blep.get();
// pass samples through the filters
float approxLinearY = blepAllpass(minPhaseY);

// It's best to use this constant, in case the filter gets redesigned later
size_t linearLatency = EllipticBlepAllpass<float>::linearDelay;
```

This needs to match the cutoff of the BLEP filter, so should **only** be used in default BLEP mode, with no sample-rate specified.

## Example: sawtooth oscillator

```cpp
struct SawtoothOscillator {
	float freq = 0.001f; // relative to sample-rate
	float amp = 1;
	
	void reset() {
		blep.reset();
		allpass.reset();
		phase = 0;
	}
	
	// next output sample
	float operator()() {
		phase += freq;
		blep.step();
		while (phase >= 1) {
			float samplesInPast = (phase - 1)/freq;
			phase = (phase - 1);
			// -2 change, order-1 (step) discontinuity
			blep.add(-2, 1, samplesInPast);
		}

		float result = (2*phase - 1); // naive sawtooth
		result += blep.get(); // add in BLEP residue

		result = allpass(result); // (optional) phase correction
		return result*amp;
	}

private:
	signalsmith::blep::EllipticBlep<float> blep;
	signalsmith::blep::EllipticBlepAllpass<float> allpass;
	float phase = 0;
};
